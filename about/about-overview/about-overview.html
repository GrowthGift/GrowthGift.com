        You may have seen butterfly effect videos like the one above. We all matter and each individual action counts, even if we can't always see the ripple we can start and be each day. By logging just 5 minutes a day and pooling that with a team of people all working toward the same cause, our individual and collective impact starts to feel real.

    <p class='margin-xlarge-b'>
      <h5 class='red margin-b'>4 spheres of impact</h5>
      <div class='margin-r margin-b'>1. <b>You</b>. Habits are the most powerful methods of behavior change and they start with a small, first step then daily repetition. The simple act of journaling will help you track your progress and motivate you to continue.</div>
      <div class='margin-r margin-b'>2. Your <b>buddy</b>. Relationships and human connection are one of the greatest sources of happiness, and accountability. Commit to something with someone and you're more likely to do it yourself, as well as help another person achieve her goal. Grow together - it's more fun and more powerful.</div>
      <div class='margin-r margin-b'>3. Your buddy <b>team</b>. Share the gift of growth with your friends and family by adding them to you and your buddy's team. See how big of a positive difference you can make together.</div>
      <div class='margin-r margin-b'>4. The <b>world</b>. Or more generally, the larger group of people in each game. It could be a small group or an entire city, working together to help each other and the world, through a collection of small, daily actions.</div>
