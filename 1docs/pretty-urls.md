# Pretty URLs

We want to make memorable, short URLs when possible. The "all G" theme is
 cool, but makes short urls more difficult. We'll use, in priortized order:

- Games: /g/gameSlug
- Game Challenge Completion: /gc/gameSlug
- Gifts: /gf/giftSlug
- Users: /u/username
- Groups: /gp/groupSlug
- Game Rules: /gr/gameRuleSlug
- User Games: /ug/gameSlug
- User Gifts: /ugf/giftSlug
