# Growth, Giving, Gratitude Games


## Overview

Weekly challenges (games) with others. Join or create a game, maybe invite
 some friends (growth buddy or group), and see how big of a positive personal
 or collective impact you can make. Same with Giving and Gratitude as other G
 Games.


## Inherently Social

"Inward out" is key so it starts by "doing yourself first." But the goal is
 to make the biggest possible positive difference. People scale in ways no
 single individual can. And people make things more fun, so the focus is on
 the group as a whole achieving the greatest total score. "1000 pushups" or
 "100,000" smiles is what is about, more than an individual achievement.

That said, it can be easy to get lost among a large group of people. One is
 the most powerful number since it is personal and manageable. The whole point
 of these games is to be decidedly focused on ONE thing and the smallest next
 step, knowing that a large series of small steps builds habits and creates a
 big difference over time. Additionally, "accountabilibuddies" work.

Impact is achieved two ways: the more you do individually, and the more
 total people doing it. So each person's charge for each game is 3 parts
 (each a different sphere / level of outward reach).

1. do as much as you can individually
2. help your champion (accountability buddy) - your ONE personal connection.
 You are welcome to encourage and communicate with ALL game players during
 the game, but just focus on yourself and your ONE buddy. Communicate with
 and encourage them each and every day. You two are making it together.
3. recruit as many people to join the game and play with you as possible.
 This will almost ALWAYS be the way to have the most impact, effectively
 allowing you to multiply your score and that of the group many times over.

The flow will thus be:

1. choose and join a game for the week.
2. choose your own personal (individual) goal for the week and optionally a
 "reach" goal too.
3. Invite other people and request ONE of them to be your champion. Only ONE
 champion request may be active at a time. But at any time (i.e. if your
 requested champion does not join), you can cancel a pending request and
 request someone else OR you can auto match up with another player in the
 game (who does not yet have a buddy). A buddy is not required but is
 highly encouraged. We suggest a DIFFERENT champion each week. Again while
 not required, we'll prompt requesting someone else if the user has already
 paired with this person in the past 2 weeks.
  1. Each person who you invited who joins the game then counts toward your
   total "reach" score.
  2. 3 scores will be displayed for you:
    1. Your score 
    2. Your champion's score
    3. Your reach score (sum of all scores of people you invited)
4. once the game starts, do as much as you can each day and check in with
 your champion to help them do as much as they can. Together see how much you
 two can accomplish!

The game goal is to achieve the biggest total score for the entire group (all
 game players).

Each game will have ONE main "action" to do. This will be the "score". An
 action could be "pushups", "smiles", or any number of things.


### Business Value

This also helps business goals (virality, user growth). Hustle (inorganic
 growth throuh direct sales and outreach) is vital in the beginning to
 seed the user base, but retention and user sharing rapidly become far more
 important. So focusing on these two things - how many users play a game the
 next week (are retained every week) and how many users invite a new user to
 play with them (and how many they invite and what percent convert).


### Human Connection, Limited App Communication

Originally, app triggered notifications were seen as a key for engagement.
 For example, a user could follow other users and then would be automatically
 notified each time someone they were following completed a challenge. This
 would help keep users coming back and engaged with other game players and
 friends. The goal is the same (keep people engaged) BUT we want to focus
 (exclusively) on personal, human interaction. Meaning face to face is
 better than video calls, is better than phone, is better than SMS text, is
 better than email, is better than in app communication. We want people to
 connect, OUTSIDE the app, not within it. So we actually want to try to limit,
 or avoid all together, app notifications and messages. The whole point is
 to make an impact, in the REAL world, not online within the application.
 And we want it to be highly targeted and personal - JUST with their buddy,
 ONE other person to focus on that week. No decision paralysis or feeling
 overwhelmed with too many people to check in on and encourage. It's clear,
 there's ONE person for you to focus on this week, that's it. One action,
 one person, one day at a time. Just 5 minutes a day, you and your buddy.

So users are still heavily encouraged to communicate, daily. But they're
 encouraged to do it the old fashioned way. Call or text their champion.
 If they were paired with a new person they do not yet have contact info
 for (phone number, email, etc.), exchange it (via a button in the app,
 no custom message), then start and continue the conversation outside the app.

Likewise, no following (friends) or groups in the app. Your "group" is your
 fellow players in the game. And you're "following" your champion (buddy) for
 the week. And you're inviting NEW people to join and be buddies with each
 week, not existing ones. Stay focused. No need to maintain a list of friends
 or groups; this may actually be counter productive to the point.


## Starting Out - KISS

Keep It Simple, Stupid.

- all games are 1 week (5 days - Sun afternoon to Fri afternoon)
- this week & next week: sign up for games just 1 week in advance
  - enforce this by simply not allowing games to be created more
   than 1 week in advance - there's always only ONE start date available
   to choose - next week.
- SAME challenge every day per game (week)
- max 1 private game and 1 public game per week
  - private: build / strengthen connection
  - public: greatest positive impact
  - scarcity, moderation; prevent overload 
    - thus only 2 of growth, giving, gratitude can be done per week
    - 2 days off each week
    - once join a private game for the next week, can no longer be
     invited to or join another. Same with public.

Keep flexibility in the database schema for adding variety later, but start
 simple. Less user decisions and quicker time to playing an actual game.


## Replace Journal with Games

Instead of randomly journaling on one or all of grateful, give, grow each
 day, choose one or more people to focus on one particular piece with for a
 week. Kind of like Alex & James' google doc challenges.
That said, you can play "solo", even though it's discouraged. This is
 effectively the original journaling idea if you play alone.

"Gifts" becomes the longer term goals equivalent and the app is
 basically 2 things - daily / weekly lifestyle / habit growth, giving
 and gratitude and then longer term growth & giving achievements. But
 it's all in the same vein. The gifts can be added on later as ways to
 make the G3 Games more targeted to work toward longer term goals. The
 "next steps" and accountability comes baked in via people doing the games
 together. So the concept becomes simple: "I want to grow / give, so I'm
 going to do it with one or more other people, to make it fun and keep me
 accountable."


## Levels

Add in difficulty level for progressions and start to merge in with Gifts and
 coaching / training to help accomplish these harder challenges / games. For
 example, have a (OneRoom) training session 1-3 times per week to help people.


## Regions / Size

Start with public games all being "worldwide" but later add in a game location
 and radius such that only people in that region can join.


## Inviting

"Luke is doing Gratitude Games this week and would like to play with /
 challenge you. Download the app to join him."
Then a way to accept or reject the request.
If accept, then each day, notify the other person / people when you complete
 yours.

  - For private games, notify everyone
    - Though perhaps be "smart" about it to prevent overload to make it depend
     on the number of game players
  - For public games, notify of friend or group member actions and key
   milestones. Again be smart and selective to prevent notification overload.


## Games

Pre-seed with challenges in each of the 3 categories (random acts of
 kindness, etc.) and allow users to create new challenges to add to the
 list.


## Rewards / Leaderboard

Track the "biggest possible growth / giving / gratitude" impact each week
 and highlight those teams on the "All Games" page. The most completions wins.
 So 5 people in a game doing something every day for a week would be 35 total
 possible completions. So show "35 growths / gives / gratitudes" on the
 leaderboard if get 100% of them, 30 if miss 5, etc.

Individual "Grower / Giver of the Week" and "Your Happiness" for gratitude
 for each Game Group. Show these on All Games home page as well as individual
 champs.
If everyone completes every single day for week, reward with something?

  - "perfect score" social media share?
  - feature one or all the winner's "giving story / top giving goal" and / or
   top growth goal on the All Gifts page to help them build quorum.
  - give OneRoom credits or something else more tangible?
  - game mechanics and tracking of all accomplishments?
