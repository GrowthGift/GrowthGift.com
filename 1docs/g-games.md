# Growth, Giving, Gratitude Games


## Overview

Weekly challenges (games) with others. Join or create a game, maybe invite
 some friends (growth buddy or group), and see how big of a positive personal
 or collective impact you can make. Same with Giving and Gratitude as other G
 Games.


## Starting Out - KISS

Keep It Simple, Stupid.

- all games are 1 week (5 days - Sun afternoon to Fri afternoon)
- this week & next week: sign up for games just 1 week in advance
  - enforce this by simply not allowing games to be created more
   than 1 week in advance - there's always only ONE start date available
   to choose - next week.
- SAME challenge every day per game (week)
- max 1 private game and 1 public game per week
  - private: build / strengthen connection
  - public: greatest positive impact
  - scarcity, moderation; prevent overload 
    - thus only 2 of growth, giving, gratitude can be done per week
    - 2 days off each week
    - once join a private game for the next week, can no longer be
     invited to or join another. Same with public.

Keep flexibility in the database schema for adding variety later, but start
 simple. Less user decisions and quicker time to playing an actual game.


## Replace Journal with Games

Instead of randomly journaling on one or all of grateful, give, grow each
 day, choose one or more people to focus on one particular piece with for a
 week. Kind of like Alex & James' google doc challenges.
That said, you can play "solo", even though it's discouraged. This is
 effectively the original journaling idea if you play alone.

"Gifts" becomes the longer term goals equivalent and the app is
 basically 2 things - daily / weekly lifestyle / habit growth, giving
 and gratitude and then longer term growth & giving achievements. But
 it's all in the same vein. The gifts can be added on later as ways to
 make the G3 Games more targeted to work toward longer term goals. The
 "next steps" and accountability comes baked in via people doing the games
 together. So the concept becomes simple: "I want to grow / give, so I'm
 going to do it with one or more other people, to make it fun and keep me
 accountable."


## Levels

Add in difficulty level for progressions and start to merge in with Gifts and
 coaching / training to help accomplish these harder challenges / games. For
 example, have a (OneRoom) training session 1-3 times per week to help people.


## Regions / Size

Start with public games all being "worldwide" but later add in a game location
 and radius such that only people in that region can join.


## Inviting

"Luke is doing Gratitude Games this week and would like to play with /
 challenge you. Download the app to join him."
Then a way to accept or reject the request.
If accept, then each day, notify the other person / people when you complete
 yours.
 - For private games, notify everyone
  - Though perhaps be "smart" about it to prevent overload to make it depend
   on the number of game players
 - For public games, notify of friend or group member actions and key
  milestones. Again be smart and selective to prevent notification overload.


## Games

Pre-seed with challenges in each of the 3 categories (random acts of
 kindness, etc.) and allow users to create new challenges to add to the
 list.


## Rewards / Leaderboard

Track the "biggest possible growth / giving / gratitude" impact each week
 and highlight those teams on the "All Games" page. The most completions wins.
 So 5 people in a game doing something every day for a week would be 35 total
 possible completions. So show "35 growths / gives / gratitudes" on the
 leaderboard if get 100% of them, 30 if miss 5, etc.

Individual "Grower / Giver of the Week" and "Your Happiness" for gratitude
 for each Game Group. Show these on All Games home page as well as individual
 champs.
If everyone completes every single day for week, reward with something?
  - "perfect score" social media share?
  - feature one or all the winner's "giving story / top giving goal" and / or
   top growth goal on the All Gifts page to help them build quorum.
  - give OneRoom credits or something else more tangible?
  - game mechanics and tracking of all accomplishments?
