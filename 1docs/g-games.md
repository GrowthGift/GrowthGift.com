# Growth, Giving, Gratitude Games


## Overview

Weekly or monthly challenges (games) with others. Find / recruit a
 growth buddy or group, pick a game and duration, and see how many
 people can play a flawless game. It's friendly competition so you try
 to win but also encourage your team to all succeed. Same with Giving
 and Gratitude as other G Games.


## Replace Journal with Games

Instead of randomly journaling on one or all of grateful, give, grow each
 day, choose one or more people to focus on one particular piece with for a
 week. Kind of like Alex & James' google doc challenges.
That said, you can play "solo", even though it's discouraged. This is
 effectively the original journaling idea if you play alone.

"Gifts" becomes the longer term goals equivalent and the app is
 basically 2 things - daily / weekly lifestyle / habit growth, giving
 and gratitude and then longer term growth & giving achievements. But
 it's all in the same vein. The gifts can be added on later as ways to
 make the G3 Games more targeted to work toward longer term goals. The
 "next steps" and accountability comes baked in via people doing the games
 together. So the concept becomes simple: "I want to grow / give, so I'm
 going to do it with one or more other people, to make it fun and keep me
 accountable."


## Inviting

"Luke is doing Gratitude Games this week and would like to play with /
 challenge you. Download the app to join him."
Then a way to accept or reject the request (auto reject in 48 hours if no
 response).
If accept, then each day, notify the other person / people when you complete
 yours.


# Games

Pre-seed with challenges in each of the 3 categories (random acts of
 kindness, etc.) and allow users to create new challenges to add to the
 list.


# Rules

- Can only be in one game of each type (Growth, Giving, Gratitude) at a time.
- Games are max 1 month in duration (if you want to go longer, just run
 another one after). The reasoning is to keep things fresh and focused.


## Rewards / Leaderboard

Track the "biggest possible growth / giving / gratitude" impact each week
 and highlight those teams on the "All Games" page. The most completions wins.
 So 5 people in a game doing something every day for a week would be 35 total
 possible completions. So show "35 growths / gives / gratitudes" on the
 leaderboard if get 100% of them, 30 if miss 5, etc.

Individual "Grower / Giver of the Week" and "Your Happiness" for gratitude
 for each Game Group. Show these on All Games home page as well as individual
 champs. Also show (head to head) group champs.
Maybe allow winner to choose title among a set? Or create their own?
If everyone completes every single day for week, reward with something?
  - "perfect score" social media share?
  - feature one or all the winner's "giving story / top giving goal" and / or
   top growth goal on the All Gifts page to help them build quorum.
  - give OneRoom credits or something else more tangible?
  - game mechanics and tracking of all accomplishments?


## Starting Out - KISS

Keep It Simple, Stupid.
In the beginning, ALL games will be 1 week long with one (SAME) challenge per day.
 Keep flexibility in the database schema for adding variety later, but start
 simple. Less user decisions and quicker time to playing an actual game.
