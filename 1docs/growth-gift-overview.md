# Overview


## Slogans

Enabling growth and connection.
Empowering growth through connection.

Grow together.


## Goal

Help people connect (online) face to face to grow and give together.
Empower anyone to give (teach) by matching them with a network of people
 who want to grow (learn) what that person wants to give (teach).
And on the growth side, use interaction and connection (with a bit of
 tracking too) to help people grow more and faster.


## How?

Get people thinking about, on a daily basis, how they want to grow and give.
 By collecting and tracking this information, we build a database of growers
 and givers. We can then connect people who either want to grow in the same
 way (they can grow together) or where one person wants to give what other
 people want to grow in. It's simple matching. Online dating for service and
 personal improvement. The bigger the database we can amass of growth and
 giving goals, the more connections we can make.
Once we get 15 to 30 "growers" and 1 "giver" for a particular topic / skill
 / gift, we will suggest they use an online learning platform such as OneRoom
 for the giver to teach the growers.

High level: 1. a journal, 2. next steps (for giving & growing), 3. connecting
 people to achieve those next steps.


## More specifics


### Social

People (relationships) is the key and has to be baked in from the start. Each
 action or "list addition" should ideally invole another person (or two) in
 in some way, even if just a mention of being grateful for that person.
 It's all about connection, and connection means building and strengthening
 relationships, so everything should be aimed toward that. Personal growth is
 the one potential exception as you can grow alone. Though we want to encourage
 "group growth" - growing with other people. And that's where more of our value
 is - while our tracking and measurement helps, people don't need an app or
 website to track their own growth or to grow.

The business case for baked in social interaction is pretty obvious - virality.
 Encourage people to recruit their friends. Ask WHO they'd like to give or grow
 with.


### Solo value

A G3 Journal (Gratitude, Grow, Give) and next steps (breaking it down into
 smaller, 1 hour or less tasks) is the way to get people to download the app
 and use it daily, even if no other people / friends are using it yet. I keep
 a gratitude journal myself and haven't been good about doing it daily so I'd
 appreciate and use an app to journal in and that reminded me and encouraged
 me to do it regularly. This could also lead into preparing nice heart felt
 gifts to people (a month of all the things I'm grateful for about my Mom / 
 significant other / etc.) as well as personal perspective of all the growth,
 giving, and happy memories someone has had over the months / years.


### Weekly Social Challenges

Challenge a friend (or strangers) to grow, give, or practice gratitude with
 you for a week. These are more of the lifestyle / habit focused things to
 do on a daily basis, though they CAN be a (step of a) "gift" (growth goal
 , give goal). Anyone can create a new challenge and we'll pre-seed challenges
 with things like "random acts of kindness".
These will be the primary way to try to make the app go viral and take off.
 We'll publicize it by asking friends and strangers to join a weekly
 challenge with us or with their own friends.
Then once they have downloaded and are using the app, we'll encourage them
 to fill out their profile (grow & give goals, strengths) and start journaling,
 as well as to keep up the weekly challenges each week, ideally adding in
 new people each week. "Join the movement to help the world be more giving, 
 grateful, and grow together."


### Database schema

- journal
  - give
    - optional WHO you gave with
  - grow
    - optional WHO helped you grow today / in this way?
  - grateful
    - WHO: thank someone
- gifts (skills)
  - grow / want (how I want to grow)
    - WHO do you want grow with?
    - next steps (link to another gift want, but smaller in scope)
    - optional why? (tell your story)
  - level / have (strengths, things I could give)
    - optional WHO helped you achieve this / gain this gift?
  - give / share (how I want to give)
    - optional WHO you want to give with
    - next steps (link to another gift share, but smaller in scope)
    - optional why? (tell your story)

Each gift thus has 3 core attributes, which are a combination of your strengths
 and passions. 1. your (current) "level" (strength) at that gift as well as how
 passionate you are about 2. giving (teaching) it and about 3. growing
 (improving) it.
