# Email (Weekly) Newsletter

We want to share updates with our users and incentivize them to join new games.

In general, we want to show both the total activity for the week (across ALL
 games) BUT highlight (randomly or featured) 1 to 3 of them per each category.
 So balance specifics with totals.

Format / template: mimic Dropprice newsletter.

- next week's (upcoming) games
  - Show X games happening next week and then "Y other games"
  - [LATER] Show how many games for next week that user is already in.
- this (past) week's games
  - Total positive change made ( e.g. 45 plank minutes completed by 5 players)
    - Show X games worth (select randomly or by featured games) and then
     show "Y other games this week" for the rest.
      - E.g. "45 plank minutes completed by 5 players. And 3 other games this week."
  - Awards earned
    - Pull all awards earned that week and then for each award type, show X
     number of them and then "Y other winners"
      - E.g. "Impact Award: Joe Bob & Sally Sue. And 4 other winners."
  - [LATER] Testimonials (game feedback)
    - Show X number of game feedback.
- [LATER] blog posts / community
